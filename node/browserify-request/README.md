# Use Node and Browserify to talk to ArcGIS Services

to do

## Prerequisites

working node/npm installation

## Development Steps

1. cd into the folder and run `npm install` to lay down the project's dependencies
2. call `npm start` and check out the site running at [http://localhost:1337]
2. call `npm run compile` to build a new local copy of the source after you make your own changes

[live sample](http://esri.github.io/developer-support/node/browserify-request/index.html)

## Features

* query/edit attributes of an ArcGIS hosted feature service
* less than 10kb of JavaScript (loaded in a single web request)

## Explanation of source files

### Extra credit

* refactor the Query and Edit modules to accept incoming parameters (from index.js) so that they don't need to query the DOM directly
* start using `watchify` so that you don't have to manually recompile the source each time a change is made
* improve the sample to make it do something more *interesting* :trollface:

NOTE: Feel free to update/improve this repo!

to do:
* add links to good articles on 
  * basic usage of browserify
  * npm scripts
  * dependencies vs. devDependencies
  * package.json

* add watchify link
